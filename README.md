## Description

The functionality of this application was built using jQuery and Moment.js. The HTML and CSS were provided, but all JS was written by me.

This day planner is designed to change color based on the current time. Past time blocks are displayed in grey, future time blocks in green, and the present time block in red. This application features persistent local storage for each event. The save buttons and input fields are correlated to only save the input the button is next to. Events can be overwritten or erased as needed.
